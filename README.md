## hey! i'm krishna  
a flutter developer focused on creating user-centric solutions.  



### quick intro  
i’m a final-year engineering student with experience in developing mvps. during my internships, i have worked on projects in e-learning, social networking, and other domains. i specialize in flutter, firebase, state management, bloc architecture, and building solutions that address real-world challenges.  

### tech stack & tools  
`flutter` | `dart` | `firebase (baas)` | `mongodb` | `node.js` | `react` | `java` | `git & version control`  

i'm super curious about new tech and love solving problems that actually matter. plus, collaborating with others on game-changing projects is basically the best.
